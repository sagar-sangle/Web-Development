<!-- In web development, BOM stands for Browser Object Model. 
    It's a set of objects provided by web browsers to interact with the browser window.
     While the DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a document, 
     the BOM represents the browser itself and its interactions with the document and the user.

The Browser Object Model includes objects like:

Window: The global object in the browser environment. It represents the browser window and acts as the root of the BOM. It contains methods for manipulating the browser window (e.g., resizing, navigating), as well as properties like window.location for getting or setting the current URL.

Navigator: Provides information about the browser itself, such as its name, version, and platform. It's accessible via the navigator object.

Screen: Represents the user's screen and provides information about its dimensions, color depth, etc. It's accessible via the screen object.

History: Represents the user's browsing history and allows navigation through it. It's accessible via the history object.

Location: Represents the URL of the current page and provides methods for navigating to different URLs. It's accessible via the location object.

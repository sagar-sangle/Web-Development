Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Mongoose is commonly used in Node.js applications to manage data in MongoDB.

Key Features of Mongoose:
Schema Definition:

Mongoose allows you to define the structure of the documents (or data) stored in a MongoDB collection using schemas. A schema defines the fields and their types, default values, validation rules, and more.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const kittySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    breed: String,
    age: Number
});
Models:

A model in Mongoose is a class that you can use to interact with a MongoDB collection. Models are created using schemas and provide methods to create, read, update, and delete documents.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const Kitten = mongoose.model('Kitten', kittySchema);
Validation:

Mongoose schemas support built-in validation, making it easy to enforce data integrity. You can specify required fields, set minimum and maximum values, and define custom validation logic.
Middleware:

Mongoose allows you to define middleware (also known as hooks) that can run before or after certain actions, such as saving or validating a document. This is useful for implementing business logic like hashing passwords before saving a user.
Query Building:

Mongoose provides a powerful query API to interact with MongoDB. You can perform CRUD operations and more complex queries using Mongooseâ€™s query helpers.
Plugins:

Mongoose supports plugins, which are reusable pieces of code that add functionality to your schemas and models. There are many plugins available for tasks like pagination, encryption, and more.
Example Usage:
javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

// Define a schema
const kittySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    breed: String,
    age: Number
});

// Add a method to the schema
kittySchema.methods.speak = function () {
    const greeting = this.name ? `Meow name is ${this.name}` : "I don't have a name";
    console.log(greeting);
};

// Create a model
const Kitten = mongoose.model('Kitten', kittySchema);

// Create a new kitten
const fluffy = new Kitten({ name: 'Fluffy', breed: 'Siberian', age: 2 });

// Save the kitten to the database
fluffy.save().then(() => {
    fluffy.speak();
    mongoose.connection.close(); // Close the connection when done
}).catch(err => console.log(err));
In this example:

We define a Kitten schema with fields name, breed, and age.
We add a method speak to the schema.
We create a Kitten model from the schema.
We create a new kitten document and save it to the MongoDB database.
Mongoose simplifies working with MongoDB by providing a more structured and organized approach to handling data in Node.js applications.

/**
 * In JavaScript, middleware refers to a function or a series of functions that are executed in between the incoming request and the server's response in web applications. Middleware functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle, typically denoted by the next parameter.

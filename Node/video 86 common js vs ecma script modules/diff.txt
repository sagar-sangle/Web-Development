ECMAScript (ES):
ECMAScript is the standardized specification for the scripting language that JavaScript is based on. It defines the syntax, semantics, and core features of JavaScript.
JavaScript implementations, such as those found in web browsers and Node.js, adhere to the ECMAScript specification.
New versions of ECMAScript are released periodically, introducing new language features and improvements. For example, ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced many new features such as arrow functions, classes, and modules.


CommonJS:
CommonJS is a module system for JavaScript that was originally designed for server-side JavaScript environments, specifically Node.js.
It provides a way to organize and structure JavaScript code into reusable modules, allowing developers to write modular and maintainable code.
CommonJS modules use the require() function to import other modules and the module.exports or exports objects to export values from a module.
CommonJS is synchronous by default, meaning modules are loaded synchronously, which can potentially block the event loop in certain environments.
